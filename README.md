### 📌 **GitHub 2FA Issue Solved – Fix "Two-Factor Code Verification Failed"**  

🚀 **If you're unable to verify your GitHub 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication) code, the issue might be caused by incorrect time settings on your mobile device.**  
This guide will help you **fix it in seconds!** ⏳  

---

## ❌ **Problem: GitHub 2FA Code Not Working**  
When setting up **GitHub Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**, you may see this error:  

> _"Two-factor code verification failed. Please try again."_  

This happens when the **time on your phone is out of sync** with GitHub’s servers. Since authenticator apps (Google Authenticator, Authy, Microsoft Authenticator) generate time-based one-time passwords (**TOTP**), even a **small time difference** can cause verification failures.

## ✅ **Solution: Set Your Device Time to Automatic**  

### **📱 On Android:**  
1. Open **Settings**.  
2. Go to **Date & Time**.  
3. Enable **Set time automatically** or **Use network-provided time**.  

### **📱 On iPhone (iOS):**  
1. Open **Settings**.  
2. Go to **General > Date & Time**.  
3. Toggle **Set Automatically** ON.

## 🔄 **Final Steps:**  
- **Restart your phone** after updating the time settings.  
- Open your **Authenticator app** and enter a **newly generated 2FA code**.  
- It should now work perfectly! 🎉  

---

## 💡 **Additional Tips:**  
- Save your **GitHub recovery codes** in case you lose 2FA access.  
- If the issue persists, try **removing and re-adding GitHub** in your authenticator app.  
- Use **Authy** instead of Google Authenticator to enable **cloud backups**.
